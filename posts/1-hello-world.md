Hi there, and welcome to my little corner.

This is my first post, and will probably overlap a bit with the [about](/about/) page. The plan for this blog is simple: write about my personal projects, forcing me to document them properly instead of leaving them in messy repos.

That said, I might also write a bit about my findings on personal finance, since I dove into it this year. As a sw engineer, I might try to think about ways to automate budgeting or pull performance data. 

If you are into side projects, finance hacks, etc, stick around. Let's see where this goes.
